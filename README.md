## ABOUT ME

I am Currently Pursuing Masters in Data Analytics Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston. I have 1 year experience working on a Data Science Application called Dataiku at Ericsson. Also, as a Data Science Intern at IIT Kanpur, I worked on a Machine learning Project to predict droupout rates. During my masters, I enrolled in course like Machine Learning for Engineering, Deep Learning and Neural Networks that cover the in-depth mathematics behind the Algorithms. Also, with few of the projects I gained hands-on experience of working on Data Science Projects
