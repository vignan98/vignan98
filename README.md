## ABOUT ME

I am Currently Pursuing Masters in Data Analytics Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston. I have 1 year experience working on a Data Science Application called Dataiku at Ericsson. Also, as a Data Science Intern at IIT Kanpur, I worked on a Machine learning Project to predict droupout rates. During my masters, I enrolled in courses like Machine Learning for Engineering, Deep Learning and Neural Networks that cover the in-depth mathematics behind the Algorithms. Also, with few of the projects I gained hands-on experience of working on Data Science Projects

## MY Skills

The first programming language i was introduced is 'C'. I followed the famous "Let us C" textbook and was able to code/learn all the concepts in it. During the sophomore year I got intrigued with the concepts of 'Core Java'. This lead me to cover the syallabus of Oracle Certified Java Programmer. During my Internship and masters I started learning Python, R, Sql while working on real-time projects. Here are the list of Skills that I am good at.
